# Building Custom Gloo

TheTool supports building a *lean* Gloo, that only contains desired features without bloat. It also suports the addition of user-contributed plugins.

## A Lean Gloo

TheTool allows you to build a *lean* Gloo by disabling the features you don't need.

You can get a list of available features by using the `list` command.

    thetool list

This will show all the features that are available and whether they are enabled or disabled.

```
Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             aws_lambda
Gloo Directory:   aws
Envoy Directory:  aws/envoy
Enabled:          true

Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             google_functions
Gloo Directory:   google
Envoy Directory:  google/envoy
Enabled:          true

Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             kubernetes
Gloo Directory:   kubernetes
Envoy Directory:  
Enabled:          true

Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             transformation
Gloo Directory:   transformation
Envoy Directory:  transformation/envoy
Enabled:          true
```

You can disable a feature by passing the name of the feature to the `disable` command.

    thetool disable -n google_functions

You can verify the feature is disabled by listing the features.

    thetool list

```
Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             aws_lambda
Gloo Directory:   aws
Envoy Directory:  aws/envoy
Enabled:          true

Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             google_functions
Gloo Directory:   google
Envoy Directory:  google/envoy
Enabled:          false

Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             kubernetes
Gloo Directory:   kubernetes
Envoy Directory:  
Enabled:          true

Repository:       https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Name:             transformation
Gloo Directory:   transformation
Envoy Directory:  transformation/envoy
Enabled:          true
```

You can enable a disabled feature using the `enable` command.

Once you have selected the set of features you want to build Gloo with, you can proceed to build and deploy with `build` and `deploy` commands respectively.

## Different Version of Gloo

### Changing the version of Gloo
You can change the version of Gloo using the `configure` command. If you call the `configure` command without any arguments, it shows the current configuration.

    thetool configure

```
Work Dir            : repositories
Docker User         : axhixh
Envoy Builder Hash  : 6153d9787cb894c2dd6b17a1539eaeba88ae15d79f66f63eec0f4713436d74f0
Envoy Hash          : f79a62b7cc9ca55d20104379ee0576617630cdaa
Gloo Chart Hash     : b40c791412bd0c72be28cfb9c761ca9d71e604aa
Gloo Chart Repo     : https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-install.git
Gloo Hash           : cf08737718cf62bf597f88aa2068c6f6b28b9992
Gloo Repo           : https://github.com/solo-io/gloo.git
```

To use a different version of Gloo we can change the commit hash of Gloo.

    thetool configure --gloo-hash 92c98f792ca466dbfee9e4d61a02ddf28ebe3715

```
Work Dir            : repositories
Docker User         : axhixh
Envoy Builder Hash  : 6153d9787cb894c2dd6b17a1539eaeba88ae15d79f66f63eec0f4713436d74f0
Envoy Hash          : f79a62b7cc9ca55d20104379ee0576617630cdaa
Gloo Chart Hash     : b40c791412bd0c72be28cfb9c761ca9d71e604aa
Gloo Chart Repo     : https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-install.git
Gloo Hash           : 92c98f792ca466dbfee9e4d61a02ddf28ebe3715
Gloo Repo           : https://github.com/solo-io/gloo.git
```

### Changing the version of Gloo plugins

You can get a list of Gloo feature repositories using the `list-repo` command. By default, TheTool initializes with https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git as a single Gloo feature repository.

    thetool list-repo

```
Repository:  https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Commit:      282a844ea3ed2527f5044408c9c98bc7ee027cd2
```

You can use the `update` command to update the commit hash of any feature repository. To update the commit hash of the default feature repository we can use the command:

    thetool update -r https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git -c bf260ff8a0d110ba9e43463f0a08445f4e858f8b

```
Updated repository https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git to commit hash bf260ff8a0d110ba9e43463f0a08445f4e858f8b
```

You can verify it updated by getting the list of feature repository.

    thetool list-repo

```
Repository:  https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Commit:      bf260ff8a0d110ba9e43463f0a08445f4e858f8b
```

You can now build a new version of Gloo with updated plugins using `build` command.

## Gloo with User-contributed Plugins

TheTool will also help you build Gloo with user contributed features. A Gloo feature consists of a Gloo plugin and/or an Envoy filter.

The first thing you need to do is add a repository with user contributed features.

You can add or remove your feature repository using `add` and `delete` commands.

    thetool add -r https://github.com/axhixh/gloo-magic.git -c 37a53fefe0a267fe3f4704c35e3721a4b6032f2a


You can verify by looking at the repository list with `list-repo` command.

    thetool list-repo

```
Repository:  https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins.git
Commit:      7bff2ff6c6ee707d8c09100de0bb7f869bd7488d

Repository:  https://github.com/axhixh/gloo-magic.git
Commit:      7bff2ff6c6ee707d8c09100de0bb7f869bd7488d
```

When you add a Gloo feature repository, it loads the file `features.json` in the root folder to
find what features are available. It uses the file to identify the gloo plugin folder and envoy
filter folder for the feature. A [sample features.json](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins/blob/master/features.json) is available at[gloo-plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-plugins) repository.

Once the repository is added, you can use `enable` and `disable` command to select the features you want to build Gloo with before running the `build` command.
